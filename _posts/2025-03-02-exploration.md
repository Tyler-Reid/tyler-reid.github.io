# This post talks about my experiences outdoors. I grew up near the mountains in Colorado and have spent many years honing skills in camping, backpacking, skiing, climbing, mountaineering and whitewater.

_A Moose Outside_

Nature is never far away when you live in Alaska. This moose was spotted just outside my bedroom window!

_Paddleboarding down Placer River_

Alaska's many rivers afford great opportunities for travel and exploration. A friend took this photo of me on my paddle board in front of the Spencer Glacier. We camped near the lake after taking the train to a whistlestop, and floated back down the river to the road the next morning.

Exploring the mountains on foot can be a humbling experience. Vistas like this one in Hatcher Pass State Park are a common sight for the willing explorer. I've done many backpacking trips in the Colorado Rockies, Teton Range, Chugach, Kenai, and Talkeetna mountains.

Skiing is a personal passion for me. This view is from a ski trip to Zermatt, Switzerland in 2024. The Swiss have unparalleled ski infrastructure and cozy lodging to aid the exploration of thier beautiful mountains.

Local bike races in Anchorage are a great opportunity to experience a healthy, competitive atmosphere, and hopefully feel good about it afterword.

_Cook Tent on Denali_

In 2021, I made an attempt on Denali. It was a dream come true to explore this great mountain in person. Although I didn't make it to the summit, my partner and I did all our own planning, training, and logistics. It was a powerful experience.
