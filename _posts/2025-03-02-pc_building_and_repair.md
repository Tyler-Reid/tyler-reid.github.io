# This page talks about my experience building PCs and repairing computers. I've done several custom PC configurartions and builds and performed complex repair jobs on difficult-to-work-on laptops.

_My First Build_

This is my first PC build from 2020. It was tough to source some components, like the GPU during that time, but I got lucky. With the help of some friends, I specced out the components, ensured compatibility, and assembled it on my own. This build prioritized cost over form.
Components include:
- Intel 10600k CPU
- Asus TUF 2060 Ti GPU
- Asus Prime z590-A Motherboard
- Arctic Liquid Freezer II 240 AOI CPU Cooler
- G.Skill Ripjaws V 32 GB DDR4-3600 CL16 RAM
- Samsung 970 Evo 1 TB NVME SSD
- Corsair 4000D Airflow ATX Case
- EVGA SuperNOVA 750 W 80+ Gold Power Supply
- Arctic P12 PWN Fans

_Clean Cabling_

I'm proud of the clean cabling in the back of my first build. It's tidy and easy to reference. There also are not a lot of cables, because the build does not include any extra RGB lighting or an excess of components.

_Macbook Pro 2017 Dissasembl - No Pokemon were harmed in this laptop repair_
Sometimes hardware needs maintenance. I performed maintenance on my 2017 Macbook Pro, a notoriously difficult laptop to work on due to its extreme size and highly proprietary components. Jobs included battery replacement and a CPU thermal paste replacment, as seen in the picture above. This job required a complete dissassembly.

_Open Bench_
Sometimes all the parts needed for a new build are not available at the same time. This open bench configuration allowed me to test compatibility and benchmark most of the components for a new PC build before the case was released. Although not ideal for long term use, all the components function well and the computer works normally, despite being spread out on a table.

_Complete Build_
After the case came out, I put together this new build in 2023 with an eye more toward aestetics and a desire for more updated components. 
Components Include:
- Intel 13700 CPU
- Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360 AIO CPU Cooler
- Asus ROG STRIX z790-H Motherboard
- G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 32 GB DDR5-6400 CL32 RAM
- Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB NVME SSD
- AMD Sapphire PULSE Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU
- Lian Li O11 D Evo RGB ATX Case
- Corsair RM1000e 1000W 80+ Gold Power Supply
- A whole bunch of Lian Li Uni Fan SL-Infinity 120mm fans

I think it turned out pretty nice and it looks amazing, but you don't want to see the cabling on this one!
